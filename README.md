# Temporal Signals Classification using CNN

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for classifying temporal signals using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to explore how CNNs can effectively extract features from time series data for accurate classification.

## Features

- Generating temporal signals (e.g. sine waves with different frequencies, step signals, noisy signals)
- Implementation of a CNN-based classification model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Training, hyperparameter-tuning and evaluation the model
- Visualization of training curves and prediction results
